- robust high-resolution face/landmark detection with better detail representation (e.g. piece-wise lines)
- handle secondary face features: glasses, facial hair, makeup, jewelry
- incremental training for face detection and matching
- investigate visual words approach to matching
- image+text features fusion for better/quicker matching
- roll/pitch/yaw head pose estimation and posting as r[RPY] face/profile region attribute
- NearDup/ImageMatcher improvement: MPEG7, out of 5 image filters, consider 2 most effective and fast
- beyond faces: matching techniques for med, pets, pills, etc.
- artificial neural net (ANN) based face detection
- same/same/different approach to inter-face distance
- guided (snap-on) feature extraction, e.g. from the detected/annotated eye, nose, mouth regions
